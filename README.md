# Stellar Classification with SDSS Data

## Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning model built to classify celestial objects such as galaxies, stars, and quasars based on spectral characteristics. The model utilizes data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), a comprehensive survey of space.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 100,000 observations of celestial objects, each described by 18 feature columns. These features include:

- **obj_ID**: Object Identifier, unique value identifying the object in the image catalog used by the CAS.
- **alpha**: Right Ascension angle (at J2000 epoch).
- **delta**: Declination angle (at J2000 epoch).
- **u, g, r, i, z**: Photometric filter measurements in the ultraviolet, green, red, near-infrared, and infrared spectrum, respectively.
- **run_ID, rereun_ID, cam_col, field_ID**: Identifiers for the specific scan, rerun, camera column, and field number.
- **spec_obj_ID**: Unique ID for optical spectroscopic objects. Different observations with the same spec_obj_ID share the output class.
- **class**: Object class (galaxy, star, or quasar object).
- **redshift**: Redshift value based on the increase in wavelength.
- **plate, MJD, fiber_ID**: Plate ID, Modified Julian Date, and fiber ID used for each observation.

## Tools and Libraries
The machine learning model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python's popular data science libraries, including:
- scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model.
- pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
